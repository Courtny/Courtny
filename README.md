# Hi, I’m [Courtny](https://courtnycotten.com/) 👋

I’m a product design leader and systems thinker who enjoys building tools, platforms, and experiences that scale. Especially where craft, technology, and people intersect.

A few things that I do:

🎨 Lead and evolve design systems that power complex, multi-surface products (web, mobile, and emerging AI interfaces).  
🧠 Design AI-assisted workflows and interfaces that prioritize trust, clarity, and user agency.  
🛠 Build and ship developer- and expert-facing platforms for deeply invested communities.  
📐 Care deeply about craft, accessibility, and durable design foundations that teams can move fast on.  
📚 Write and think about design impact, metrics, and the role of systems in long-lived products.  
🎲 Dungeon Master and lifelong tabletop RPG player; I love games as systems, stories, and social tools.

Previously, I’ve led design for large-scale platforms at Stack Overflow and Microsoft, worked on industry-defining connected car experiences, and partnered closely with engineering and product to ship zero-to-one and scaling efforts.

Outside of work, I run an [airsoft & paintball field](coyoteforce.com), design and photograph all of its branding and creative, collect retro games and LEGO, and spend as much time as I can with my daughters.

You can find me on my website, or exploring new ideas wherever design, systems, and storytelling overlap.
